title: Where to take my talents to - a world happiness analysis

---
### Abstract

In the summer of 2010, in a much anticipated decision, NBA all-star Lebron James announced to the world that he would be taking his talents to South Beach to join the Miami Heat. This makes us question - is Miami, Florida really the best place for one to take their talents to? In this report, we analyze the World Happiness Report dataset to determine the top destinations around the world in terms of overall happiness. The happiness scores utilize data from the Gallup World Poll which collects answers in a Candril ladder survey format. Respondents are asked to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst being a 0 and to rate their current lives on such scale. The dataset consists of over 150 countries from the years 2015 to 2020, consisting of features such as life expectancy, economic product, corruption and much more. While our travel decisions may not be as complicated as Lebron Jamesâ€™, we hope to analyze the dataset to effectively assess the past, current and future well-being of nations around the world.

### Preprocessing 

For each year's dataframe, we will preprocess the data by determinig if there are any invalid entries. Specifically, any values of NaN or 0 (when not appropriate), will be treated by taking the mean of the remaining values in the column. We then concatenate all the dataframes to form a final version which includes all the years.

{include tables, plots, etc.}

We observe that the values with zero/null can in fact be replaced by the mean of the remaining entries for the corresponding column. The only columns where this wouldn't make sense is for `Country` and `Happiness_Rank`. We note that `y2020` has no invalid entries.

We now mask all zero/null entries with the corresponding column mean.

We also observe a discrepancy in units used between the `y2020` dataframe vs. the rest. Specifically, the `GDP_per_capita` and `Healthy_life_expectancy` are notably different magnitudes in y2020. Additionally, the range of values in certain columns of `y2020` are much greater than the other years. For example, for Finland the corresponding values are:

* `GDP_per_capita`: 10.64 (2020) vs. 1.34 (2019)
* `Healthy_life_expectancy`: 71.90 (2020) vs. 0.99 (2019)

We decide to address this issue by normalizing the data for all columns that *do not* belong to `Country`, `Happiness_Score` and `Happiness_Rank`.

We also note that normalizing the data for each year's dataframe will re-introduce zero values. However, the interpretation is different from having invalid entries.

### What affects a country's happiness score?

We evaluate the signifance of each feature for the given dataframe to determine what factors affect a country's happiness score. Additionally, we examine if any features are more correlated than others.

We observe at the 95% significance level that `Perceptions_of_corruption` is not deemed significant.

{% include plots/heatmap.html %}

We notice that from the correlation heatmap that there exists a strong correlation between `GDP_per_capita` and `Healthy_life_expectancy`. This observation is expected as wealthier countries tend to have a better environment and infrastructure that supports healthy living. Some examples of this include better hospital facilities, access to better nutrition, and programs that promote an active lifestyle.

### Are countries in specific geographic regions happier?

We now shift gears and try to analyze the impacts geographic location has on a country's happiness score. Specifically, we evaluate the `y2020` dataset to determine if neighbouring countries or countries belonging to the same continent are similar in their happiness score. We apply an unsupervised K-means clustering approach to label countries into corresponding continents. As such, we use a cluster size of 7 to resemble the number of continents around the world.

While one approach may be to consider all features in the dataset and then applying a dimensionality reduction method such as t-SNE or PCA, we decide to apply K-means on just the `Happiness_Score`. The analysis is thus performed in one dimension, in which the data points are plotted linearly.

{% include plots/sse-vs-k.html %}

{% include plots/scatter-k-means.html %}

We propose an unsupervised approach to learn geographic continents solely based on happiness scores from our dataset. From the above plots, we see that this approach performs fairly poorly in grouping countries based on this criteria. While we do see some countries that are more dominant in certain clusters (e.g. Europe within clusters 1, 5 and 6), there does not seem to be enough supporting evidence for such approach to work. As a result, we conclude that countries belonging to a specific continent do not necessarily share similar happiness scores.

### K-means for multiple variables
We repeat the process but this time we do it taking into account the to most important covariates for our model.

{% include plots/3d-scatter-1.html %}

Then the clusters colored by continent:

{% include plots/3d-scatter-2.html %}

We propose an unsupervised approach to learn geographic continents, but this time based on happiness scores as well as the GDP_per_capita and the Healthy life expectancy. From the above plots, we see that it perfoms a better but even so, this method still remains a poor one.

### Trends in happiness

We now evaluate the trends in happiness levels over the years from 2015 to 2020. We calculate the mean happiness scores for all countries belonging in each year to see if there exists an evident trend over time. We also look at specific countries that are selected at random from one of the seven clusters defined previously. Recall that each cluster is supposed to represent a grouping of countries with similar happiness scores. As a result, the analysis will be able to display trends in happiness of countries spanning the whole range (from very unhappy to very happy).

The above plot reveals that the average happiness score for all countries experienced a very minimal increase over the years. There does not seem to be enough supporting evidence to explain this *tiny* increase, especially over such a short time period and after considering the error range.

However, there are notable trends that exist between individual countries. While only some countries were sampled from the whole, it is expected that such trends would exist on an individual case by case basis. As such the displayed plots are by no means representative of the countries not displayed from the same cluster.

{% include plots/trendlines.html %}

Countries such as Brazil and Zimbabwe have been experiencing a sharp decline in happiness scores over the past five years. This may be as a result of numerous factors such as increased corruption, lack of government intervention or worsened social services. We notice that Brazil's happiness score was more or less constant from 2015 to 2016. The decline it experienced afterwards may be attributed by hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics as it incurred significant debt and had to make drastic cuts in other areas of spending such as healthcare. This is contrast to the trend Estonia has experienced over the years.

### MATCHING

First we calculate the median of GPD per capita and then we create a dummy variable, indicating with 1 the countries that have a GPD greater than the median, and with 0 the countries with a GPD lower than the median.

Then, for each characteristic of the dataset, we compare the control group with the treatment group.

```

We can see a notable difference between the model with non-matched and the one with matched samples in the majority of values.

All the variables involved in the calculation of the Propensity score are much more equal.
Although the values have been equalized, we can say that the richest countries are also the happiest

Another way to visualize would allow us to have a better inside knowledge on our new data.

### Conclusions

Be happy!
